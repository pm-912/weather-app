# Weather Search Application #
This is a simple application that users can use 
to find out weather in a particular city.

## Application Description ##
The website loads with a default city searched. 

The user can input a new city name in the search
field and will receive current weather conditions
as well as a 5 day forecast for the searched city.

The city is saved under recent searches where the 
user can access that data again at a simple click.

## How it Works ##
The app uses html, some css, but mostly javascript
dynamically update the page.

It uses some basic bootstrap formatting.

The application uses API calls to openweather's database 
to pull latitude and longitude numbers, then uses
those numbers to give weather conditions.
